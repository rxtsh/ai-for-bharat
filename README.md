# AI for Bharat – Public Procurement Transparency Platform

## Overview

AI for Bharat is an AI-powered transparency enhancement layer designed to support public monitoring of government procurement processes.

The system analyzes public tender documents, detects potential risk patterns, and helps citizens generate structured RTI (Right to Information) requests for informed civic engagement.

⚠️ This system does NOT accuse individuals or institutions.  
It highlights statistical risk indicators to improve transparency.
